# Hope

Written in honor of Jane Goodall (April 3rd, 1934 - October 1st, 2025) who allowed her hope to change the world.

Hope. Some people will never feel it, some people will feel it too much. Some people are afraid of it, others are afraid of losing it. You may resent it, or you may long for more. It's a simple word that many of us have a complicated relationship with. But what gives us hope? Some astrologers believe it's Jupiter in domicile. A planet being in domicile is when it's in its native sign, where it feels most at home - and for Jupiter, that's Sagittarius. Jupiter, the planet of growth, expansion, luck, and abundance, and Sagittarius, the sign of freedom, adventure, and wisdom, together create a combination that enables boundless optimism. It enables hope. But what about hopes polarity, despair? What causes despair? Some astrologers believe it's the moon in the twelfth house. The moon, the subconscious mind, your emotional nature, and the twelfth house, the house of isolations, of endings, come together to create feelings of loneliness, emotional overwhelm, and despair. Hopelessness. But what does this astrologer think? That regardless of your placements, if you look hard enough at your chart, you will likely be able to find a predisposition to both hope and despair. You may even find hope rooted in despair, or despair hidden within hope. But it will be there. Because in the end, hope is something that we give ourselves. It's something we can always find, so long as we look for it. And look for it we must.
